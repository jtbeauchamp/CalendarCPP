# CalendarCPP
This program implements the use of functions to create the gregorian calendar for a given month and year and saves the calendar within a text file that is named after the month and year.

This pogram is designed to take user inputs for a month and year, and creates a file with the calendar for that month and year, where the text file follows the format "month-year.txt". The porgram includes the following C++ files: iostream for inputting and outputting, iomanip for formatting the calendar, cstring in order to create strings that will serve as the file name, and fstream that serves as the output for the file's contents. Instead of using prototypes, I coded the function definitions before main. These functions inclide getDaysInMonth, getDaysOfTheWeek, and printCalendar. Starting with getDaysInMonth, the function's parameters stores the month and year inside variables "month" and "year" respectively. Using a switch case for the month values, if the month is equal to 4,6,9, or 11, the function returns 30 since there are 30 days in that month. If the month is equal to 2, the case returns either 28 or 29 which depends on a formula for computing if the current year is a leap year. Should the month value not fall under the first two cases, it is given the default case value of 31 and returns that value. The next function is getDaysOfTheWeek
